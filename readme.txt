Starting from overlaying the path of Jupiter in MWATS data and making movies to demonstrate its celestial motions, I moved on to deal with unusually bright transients, of which the potential sources were suspected to be satellites in circular porization surveys and successfully idenfied them as five low-earth-orbit satellites by conducting a cross match with the catalog of all the registered satellites. The errors in position estimation is smaller than the angular resolution of MWA, which supports a perfect identification.
